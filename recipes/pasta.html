        <li>Add the flour and salt to a mixing bowl and whisk together.</li>
        <li>Create a well in the center of the flour mixture and crack the eggs into the well.</li>
        <li>Using a fork or your hands, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough forms. If the dough is too dry, add water a teaspoon at a time until it comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>

        <li>Cut the pasta into your desired shape (like fettuccine or spaghetti) using a pasta cutter or knife.</li>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the pasta. Cook for 2-3 minutes (depending on the thickness of the pasta) until it's al dente.</li>
