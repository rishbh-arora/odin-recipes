    <h2>Let's talk about it first</h2>
    <p>Cake is a baked dessert that is typically made from a mixture of flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil, and other ingredients such as baking powder, vanilla extract, and milk. Cakes come in a variety of flavors and styles, ranging from simple and classic like vanilla or chocolate, to more elaborate designs such as layer cakes, cheesecakes, and specialty cakes for occasions like weddings and birthdays.</p>
    <p>Cakes can be served on their own or topped with frosting, glaze, or other decorations such as fruit, nuts, and sprinkles. They are a popular dessert around the world, and have been enjoyed for centuries in various forms. Today, cake is often associated with celebrations and special occasions, but it can also be enjoyed as a simple and satisfying treat any time.</p>
